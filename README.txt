When we get an NS from the route server we automatically go straight to the TS before writing a response for the queryif the resolved text fileIs 
thought of as the end-user then we see that it never gets an NS record
rather our client program will recursively handle the record until we either get an a record or not found

2. There are no known issues with the attached code

3. One problem we had developing this code was that after all the lines had been proccessed by DNS server

the file with python so i resorted to running unix within our client python program to edit the file


4. We gained a comprehensive understanding of how a DNS works by creating this scaled down version of One
